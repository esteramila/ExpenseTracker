# ExpenseTracker

This is the project I worked on in my Summer Practice of 2024. It is a simple web application through which the user can track their exenses. It contains 6 different web pages, with each it's own functionality: Home, Categories, Expenses, Add Expense, Incomes, Add Income. Considering how simple it is, there is no need for a help page; the way ro utilise it is self intuitive.
